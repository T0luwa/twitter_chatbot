Twitter is an online social media and social networking service owned and operated by American company X Corp., the successor of Twitter, Inc. Twitter users outside the United States are legally served by the Ireland-based Twitter International Unlimited Company, which makes these users subject to Irish and European Union data protection laws.[11][12]
On Twitter, users post texts, images and videos known as "tweets".[13][14] Registered users can tweet, like, "retweet" tweets, and direct message (DM) other registered users. Users interact with Twitter through browser or mobile frontend software, or programmatically via its application programming interfaces (APIs).
Twitter was created by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams in March 2006 and launched in July of that year. Its former parent company, Twitter, Inc. was based in San Francisco, California and had more than 25 offices around the world.[15] By 2012, more than 100 million users tweeted 340 million tweets a day,[16] and the service handled an average of 1.6 billion search queries per day.[17][18][16] In 2013, it was one of the ten most-visited websites and has been described as "the SMS of the Internet".[19] By the start of 2019, Twitter had more than 330 million monthly active users.[20] In practice, the vast majority of tweets are tweeted by a minority of users.[21][22] In 2020, it was estimated that approximately 48 million accounts (15% of all accounts) were fake.[23]
On October 27, 2022, business magnate Elon Musk acquired Twitter for US$44 billion, gaining control of the platform.[24][25][26][27] Since the acquisition, the platform has been criticized for facilitating an increase in content containing hate speech as Musk has emphasized more free speech.[28][29] On December 20, 2022, Musk announced he would step down as CEO once a replacement had been found.[30] Linda Yaccarino, the former head of ad sales for NBCUniversal, succeeded Musk as CEO on June 5, 2023.[10]

2006–2007: Creation and initial reaction

A sketch, c. 2006, by Jack Dorsey, envisioning an SMS-based social network
Twitter's origins lie in a "daylong brainstorming session" held by board members of the podcasting company Odeo. Jack Dorsey, then an undergraduate student at New York University, introduced the idea of an individual using an SMS service to communicate with a small group.[31][32] The original project code name for the service was twttr, an idea that Williams later ascribed to Noah Glass,[33] inspired by Flickr and the five-character length of American SMS short codes. The decision was also partly due to the fact that the domain twitter.com was already in use, and it was six months after the launch of twttr that the crew purchased the domain and changed the name of the service to Twitter.[34] The developers initially considered "10958" as the service's short code for SMS text messaging, but later changed it to "40404" for "ease of use and memorability".[35] Work on the project started on March 21, 2006, when Dorsey published the first Twitter message at 12:50 p.m. PST (UTC−08:00): "just setting up my twttr".[3] Dorsey has explained the origin of the "Twitter" title:[36]
...we came across the word "twitter", and it was just perfect. The definition was "a short burst of inconsequential information", and "chirps from birds". And that's exactly what the product was.
The first Twitter prototype, developed by Dorsey and contractor Florian Weber, was used as an internal service for Odeo employees.[37] The full version was introduced publicly on July 15, 2006.[8] In October 2006, Biz Stone, Evan Williams, Dorsey, and other members of Odeo formed Obvious Corporation and acquired Odeo, together with its assets—including Odeo.com and Twitter.com—from the investors and shareholders.[38] Williams fired Glass, who was silent about his part in Twitter's startup until 2011.[39] Twitter spun off into its own company in April 2007.[40] Williams provided insight into the ambiguity that defined this early period in a 2013 interview:[41]
With Twitter, it wasn't clear what it was. They called it a social network, they called it microblogging, but it was hard to define, because it didn't replace anything. There was this path of discovery with something like that, where over time you figure out what it is. Twitter actually changed from what we thought it was in the beginning, which we described as status updates and a social utility. It is that, in part, but the insight we eventually came to was Twitter was really more of an information network than it is a social network.
2007–2010
The tipping point for Twitter's popularity was the 2007 South by Southwest Interactive (SXSWi) conference. During the event, Twitter usage increased from 20,000 tweets per day to 60,000.[42] "The Twitter people cleverly placed two 60-inch plasma screens in the conference hallways, exclusively streaming Twitter messages," remarked Newsweek's Steven Levy. "Hundreds of conference-goers kept tabs on each other via constant twitters. Panelists and speakers mentioned the service, and the bloggers in attendance touted it."[43] Reaction at the conference was highly positive.[44] Twitter staff received the festival's Web Award prize with the remark "we'd like to thank you in 140 characters or less. And we just did!"[45]
The company experienced rapid initial growth. In February 2010, Twitter users were sending 50 million tweets per day.[46] In 2009, Twitter won the "Breakout of the Year" Webby Award.[47][48] On November 29, 2009, Twitter was named the Word of the Year by the Global Language Monitor, declaring it "a new form of social interaction".[49] By March 2010, the company recorded over 70,000 registered applications.[50] As of June 2010, about 65 million tweets were posted each day, equaling about 750 tweets sent each second, according to Twitter.[51] As of March 2011, that was about 140 million tweets posted daily.[52] As noted on Compete.com, Twitter moved up to the third-highest-ranking social networking site in January 2009 from its previous rank of twenty-second.[53]
